# Function: player_move(board, symbol)
#   - Purpose: Prompt the player for a move and update the board.
#   - Loop until a valid move is entered (number 1-9 and an available spot).
#   - Update the board at the chosen index with the player's symbol.

# Function: ai_move(board, ai_symbol, player_symbol)
#   - Purpose: Decide and execute the AI's move.
#   - For each free spot, simulate placing ai_symbol:
#         * If that move wins the game (using check_win), place the symbol and return.
#   - For each free spot, simulate placing player_symbol:
#         * If that move would let the player win, block it by placing ai_symbol and return.
#   - Otherwise, choose a random available move and place ai_symbol.

# Function: check_win(board, symbol)
#   - Purpose: Check if the given symbol has met any winning condition.
#   - Define winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
#   - Return True if any condition is met; otherwise, return False.

# Function: check_full(board)
#   - Purpose: Check if the board is completely filled.
#   - Return True if no cell contains a digit (i.e., all spots are taken).

# Function: tic_tac_toe()
#   - Purpose: Main game loop for Tic-Tac-Toe.
#   - Welcome the player and prompt for the player's name (display prompt in green).
#   - Loop to play games until the player chooses not to continue:
#         * Initialize the board with cell numbers.
#         * Get player's and AI's symbols via player_choice().
#         * Set the starting turn to 'Player'.
#         * While the game is on:
#               - Display the board.
#               - If it's the player's turn:
#                     > Call player_move() to get and execute the player's move.
#                     > Check if the player wins using check_win(); if so, display a win message and end the game.
#                     > Else, if the board is full, display a tie message and break.
#                     > Otherwise, set turn to 'AI'.
#               - If it's the AI's turn:
#                     > Call ai_move() to decide and execute the AI's move.
#                     > Check if the AI wins; if so, display a win message and end the game.
#                     > Else, if the board is full, display a tie message and break.
#                     > Otherwise, set turn to 'Player'.
#         * After the game ends, prompt the player if they want to play again.
#         * If the player does not type 'yes', exit the loop and thank the player.
#
# If the script is executed as the main module, call tic_tac_toe() to start the game.
